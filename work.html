          Reimagining Sephora’s product details page (PDP) to feel less like

          shopping experience.

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        We redesigned the Sephora iOS product details page to keep its premium
        brand feel while fixing usability issues that made shopping stressful:
        tiny text, cluttered layout, and confusing delivery and size options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through two rounds of user testing (8 participants total), we focused on
        helping shoppers quickly understand if a product fits their skin needs,
        compare options with less effort, and feel confident adding items to their bag.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section class="project-section project-two-column">
      <div>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cluttered, overwhelming layout</strong> – users described the
            PDP as “too much stuff on the screen” and “like a website slapped onto a phone.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hard to compare products</strong> – shoppers had to switch
            between multiple tabs and re-read long descriptions just to compare moisturizers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confusing fulfillment options</strong> – pickup & delivery
            choices were wordy and stacked, making it hard to see what was actually selected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor information hierarchy</strong> – important details like
            skin type suitability, ingredients, and “clean” badges were buried in dense text.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="project-callout">
        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Make the PDP feel clear and supportive for all types of shoppers—
          from casual gift-givers to skincare nerds—without losing Sephora’s
          luxury aesthetic.
        </p>

      <h2>Research & Key Insights</h2>
      <div class="project-grid">
        <div>
          <h3>User Testing · Round 1</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>4 participants with mixed experience using Sephora and beauty apps.</li>
            <li>Tasks: find a gift, recall a perfume, compare moisturizers, check pickup.</li>
            <li>
              People struggled most with comparing moisturizers and understanding
              fulfillment & size/price changes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What We Heard</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>“Too much stuff on the screen… hard to read and hard to see.”</li>
            <li>“I didn’t find a compare feature so I had to go back and forth.”</li>
            <li>Users relied heavily on badges & reviews but wanted clearer summaries.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Nike & Fabletics: strong hierarchy, sticky headers, clear CTAs.</li>
            <li>Ulta: more whitespace, bold fulfillment tiles, clearer shade + price.</li>
            <li>
              Takeaway: visual breathing room + consistent sections matter more
              than adding flashy features.

    <!-- DESIGN SOLUTIONS -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Redesign Highlights</h2>

      <div class="solution-block">
        <h3>1. Clear, Anchored Layout</h3>
        <p>
          We introduced a sticky top bar with product name/brand and a sticky
          “Add to Bag” button at the bottom. No matter how far users scroll, they
          always know what they’re looking at and how to act.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-block">
        <h3>2. Full-Width Hero Image Carousel</h3>
        <p>
          A large, zoomable image gallery gives shoppers an immediate visual feel
          for the product. A peek of the next image hints that they can swipe,
          reducing reliance on tiny pagination dots.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-block">
        <h3>3. Simpler Shipping & Pickup</h3>
        <p>
          We replaced dense text tiles with straightforward radio options like
          “Ship to address” and “Same-day pickup,” plus a single tile that updates
          with the current store / address. Extra details only appear after selection,
          lowering cognitive load.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-block">
        <h3>4. Light-weight Drawers for Details</h3>
        <p>
          Long, text-heavy sections became short dropdown drawers (e.g., Details,
          Ingredients, How to use). Each is scannable in under ~100 words, so
          users don’t have to wade through walls of text to understand the product.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-block">
        <h3>5. Highlights & Recommendations Carousels</h3>
        <p>
          A concise “Highlights” row surfaces skin type, texture, and key benefits
          at a glance, while “We think you’ll love” gently suggests similar products
          in a horizontal carousel instead of long grids.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- RESULTS -->
    <section class="project-section project-two-column">
      <div>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In Round 2 testing, users described Redesign A as “clean,” “usable,”
            and “easy to navigate” and reached key info (skin type, ingredients,
            pickup) more quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Highlights + drawers pattern became the primary way people checked
            if the moisturizer fit Rosalie’s skin needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sticky Add to Bag with clear “Item added successfully” state
            reduced uncertainty around checkout actions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What I’d Do Next</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a lighter, earlier comparison module using the stronger design (A).</li>
          <li>Bring in a more prominent “clean” label directly on the hero image.</li>
          <li>
            Explore adaptive layouts for newer vs. expert shoppers (e.g., quick
            summaries vs. deeper ingredient breakdowns).
          </li>
        </ul>

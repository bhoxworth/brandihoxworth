        <p>
          FlixBus is an intercity bus service that lets riders search routes, compare prices, and
          book tickets online. In class, my team evaluated the current site with usability testing to
          understand how well the booking flow supports real travelers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Across five tasks—booking a one-way trip, comparing routes, understanding stops,
          tracking a trip, and modifying a booking—we noticed repeated confusion around trip
          results, stop information, and the seat selection / extras flow. The experience often felt
          cluttered, unpredictable, and easy to misinterpret, especially when users expected an
          airline-style seat picker.

        <h2 class="ps-heading">The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Travelers struggled to understand their routes and seats. Many users missed the seat
          selection step entirely or couldn’t tell which seats were available, premium, or already
          taken. Premium fees only appeared on hover, making price changes feel like a
          surprise at checkout. At the same time, trip results showed dense lists of routes with
          unclear “direct” labels and scattered stop details, forcing users to dig for basic
          information like how many stops there were and where they would actually board. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ps-column">
        <h2 class="ps-heading">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We redesigned two key parts of the flow: the trip results / route understanding
          component and the seat selection & extras experience. A consolidated trip card makes
          stops, duration, and “no stops vs. number of stops” immediately visible. A dedicated
          “Seat Selection & Extras (Optional)” step comes <em>before</em> checkout, with a clear
          legend, high-contrast seat states, transparent pricing, and a prominent option to skip
          extras altogether. Finally, a review page summarizes seat selection in plain language,
          giving users one last chance to confirm or change their choice.

                    “Selected Seats” summary updates immediately to reduce surprises at checkout.

      <h2>Redesign Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparent route cards:</strong> consolidated trip information with a
          vertical stop timeline, clear “No stops / 4 stops” labels, and more visible map
          access so users immediately understand how their trip is structured.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Specific stop context:</strong> improved copy for boarding locations and
          map pins that can be tied to landmarks, helping riders feel confident they’ve
          picked the right station.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Dedicated “Seat Selection & Extras” step:</strong> seat selection and
          add-ons are grouped into a single page before checkout, with a bold “Optional”
          label and a prominent “Skip and continue to checkout” button.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>High-contrast seat legend:</strong> available, premium, taken, and selected
          seats use distinct colors and iconography, with the legend detached from the map
          so users can actually notice and read it. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Predictable pricing:</strong> selecting a seat updates the right-hand
          summary tile with seat type and cost—no more hidden hover tooltips or surprise
          fees on the last screen.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Review page confirmation:</strong> a dedicated Seat Selection tile on the
          review screen spells out the current state (“No seat selected yet” vs. “You’ve
          reserved a back aisle seat”) and offers clear actions to change or cancel before
          paying.
        </li>

    <section class="final-takeaways">
      <h2 class="section-title">Final Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="final-intro">
        This project reinforced how small pieces of ambiguity around stops, seat states,
        or pricing—can snowball into a booking flow that feels stressful and untrustworthy.
      </p>

      <div class="takeaways-grid">
        <div class="takeaway-card">
          <h3>Group complex decisions into clear steps</h3>
          <p>
            When key actions like seat selection and add-ons are buried inside checkout,
            users feel blindsided. Moving them to a dedicated, clearly labeled step made
            the flow more predictable and aligned with mental models from airline sites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway-card">
          <h3>Make “optional” truly feel optional</h3>
          <p>
            Explicit labels, skip buttons, and calm language go a long way in building trust.
            Labeling seat selection and upgrades as optional reduced pressure and helped
            riders feel in control instead of upsold. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway-card">
          <h3>Use review screens to lower anxiety</h3>
          <p>
            A well-designed review page is not just a recap—it’s a reassurance step.
            Showing seat status, route details, and next steps in plain language gave users
            confidence that they understood exactly what they were about to purchase.

        <p>
          The Urban Collaborative Project (UCP) is a nonprofit based in Southeastern San Diego
          that connects residents with resources in health, housing, transportation, and civic
          engagement. Their existing website was outdated, hard to navigate, and didn’t reflect
          the scale of their impact or their current programs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Our ENG 100D team partnered with UCP to redesign their Squarespace site into a
          community-centered platform that is easier to maintain, tells clearer stories about
          their work, and invites residents, partners, and volunteers to get involved.

        <h2 class="ps-heading">The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Community members, especially Spanish speakers and new visitors, struggled to
          understand what UCP does, find events, or access resources from the old site.
          Important information was buried, links were broken, navigation was unclear, and
          staff had limited time and technical capacity to keep content updated. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ps-column">
        <h2 class="ps-heading">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We redesigned the website around clear storytelling and simple navigation:
          a mission-forward homepage, an interactive projects map, a focus area “puzzle”
          interface, a Get Involved hub, and an events calendar. We also created editable
          templates and a technical handoff guide so staff can update pages and add new
          projects without needing a developer.

          <p class="section-description">
            We began with hand-drawn sketches and low-fidelity wireframes for key pages:
            the homepage, a focus-area puzzle, the projects map, and a Get Involved page.
            These helped us test information architecture with stakeholders and align on
            what content needed to be surfaced for residents, volunteers, and partner
            organizations.

            From there, we moved into high-fidelity designs in Figma and implementation
            in Squarespace. We leaned into UCP’s “putting the pieces together” motto with
            puzzle-inspired visuals, local photography, and warm colors that feel rooted in
            the neighborhood. Interactive map pins, cards, and buttons guide users toward
            events, resources, and ways to participate.

      <h2>Redesign Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mission-forward homepage:</strong> clear statement of who UCP is,
          what they do, and featured stories that show their impact.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus Area puzzle:</strong> interactive tiles that visually connect
          UCP’s five main focus areas and link to deeper content. 
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Interactive project map:</strong> Google Maps–based view of ongoing
          and past projects, with color-coded pins and popups that explain each initiative.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Get Involved hub:</strong> a single page that routes people to
          volunteer, attend meetings, collaborate as partners, or explore career
          opportunities.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Events calendar:</strong> embedded Google Calendar for meetings and
          programs, so community members can add events directly to their own calendars.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Built for handoff:</strong> page templates, content guidelines, and a
          technical manual so UCP staff can maintain and expand the site over time.

    <section class="final-takeaways">
      <h2 class="section-title">Final Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="final-intro">
        This project showed me how web design for nonprofits is as much about
        sustainability and trust as it is about visuals.
      </p>

      <div class="takeaways-grid">
        <div class="takeaway-card">
          <h3>Design with the community, not just for them</h3>
          <p>
            Interviews with community members, staff, and agency partners revealed
            very different needs—from storytelling and cultural representation to
            data, reports, and impact metrics. Balancing those perspectives created a
            more honest and effective site.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway-card">
          <h3>Sustainability is a design requirement</h3>
          <p>
            Because staff have limited time and technical support, modular components,
            editable templates, and clear documentation were just as important as the
            UI. A beautiful site that can’t be updated quickly becomes another problem.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway-card">
          <h3>Small accessibility moves add up</h3>
          <p>
            Clearer labels, simplified navigation, resource pages, and a structure that
            can later support Spanish translation all helped the site feel more welcoming
            and usable for diverse residents in Southeastern San Diego.
